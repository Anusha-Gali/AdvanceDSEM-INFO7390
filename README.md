# Stock Market Data Analysis: Insights from Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical stock market data to uncover meaningful patterns and insights that could inform investment strategies. It uses Python with libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset contains historical daily stock price data with the following columns:
- Date
- Symbol
- Series
- Prev Close
- Open
- High
- Low
- Last
- Close
- VWAP
- Volume
- Turnover
